# MIS3502 Porject Description
I created an application called bookkeeping. It allows users to deal with their bill statements. 
It also summarizes the userâ€™s gain and spend, and reminds the user whether is losing or gaining money or breakeven.

I chose an API of doughnut chart from https://www.image-charts.com/
The API is used for showing the reports of income and expenses.
Users can see the total amount of the bills grouped by categories on the charts and the total amount of income/expense in the middle circle.
